Goal Acheiving Social Media
A website (eventually app?) that allows you to set a goal(s) either public or private. 
Public goals will be shared with friends who can encourage you and send reminders if you haven't updated in a while. 
You set a goal with steps where each step has a timeframe. 
Steps can be broken down into smaller steps if goal is large. 
You are notified when a step timeframe is starting or ending.  
You can connect with people who have or have accomplished similar goals. 
Take notes along the way to share what works for you, or what doesn't for others who have same goal. 
More features to be added but this is general idea.
